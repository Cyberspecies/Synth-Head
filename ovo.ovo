To create an open source suit which can be worn by an individual and customised to their will. It also must be constructed
in such a way that an average human could build it within a reasonable budget and time. The suit must be modular whilst
remaining safe for the user to operate. The software must be easy to configure for any individual and has capability to
modify without reflashing its firmware. This is a compilation of the best features of ARCOS.
