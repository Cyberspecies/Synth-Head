# Synth Head DX
This is the first the 10th design line up, although the physical architecture is simple it layed the foundation for the other versions to be built on. <strong style='color: #ff0000;'>DO NOT FABRICATE AS IS</strong> as the shape and overall dimentions were the priority when designing this base, this version is more so to be used as an easily modifiable platform which anyone can take and customise. This version has not been created IRL as like mentioned before it was more designed for its shape.

## File Structure
<strong style='color: #bb99ff;'>XCR Head DX.f3d</strong> : The fusion 360 file which has everything that was used for the design.

<strong style='color: #bb99ff;'>XCR Head DX.step</strong> : A step file export from fusion 360 if you dont have the program.

## Features & Design Considerations
### Vacuum Formed Visor
The visor contour is designed in such a way, where the visor can rotate outwards rather then relying on the flexibility of the material to snap in place. This prevents the visor from deforming which allows substructures and other features to reliably attach to the visor material. Although a complex shape, it is relatively easy to vacuum form.

### Visor Ridge
The visor ridge of the shell was designed to "catch" the visor on the way on so that it will always be inline with the shell to leave a near seamless smooth finish. The design process is very simple, consisting of a few offsets and is proceedurly generated allowing any visor shape to fit in this way.
 
### Teeth Rotation
The teeth of the outer shell are rotated slightly along with the jaw being slightly indented. This shape prevents the jaw and the shell from colliding when it moves.

### Head Restraint
This prevents the user's head from moving within the synth head, although it is only a rudamentory design, it was created to have foam hotglued into place. The front and back pieces along with the side shell, locks the user's head in translational movement. Rotational movement is only restrained via pressure which isn't the best method as it doesnt take advantage of the oval shape of the human head, which can be used to geometrically lock the rotation properly like a bike helmet.

### Jaw Joint
The joint mechanism used here was the most tested version at that time which consists of a slot which the jaw can lock into via a teflon pin. This was later depreciated for a better design which allowed the jaw to lock into place via pressing it in and rotating it.

### Maw Top Plate
To mount components such as the display, a top plate was added to do just that. This version just showed whether or not such a design would be aesthetically pleasing along with physically advantages.

### Nose Holes
Holes in the shell served 2 purposes, the first is for it to be accurate to the species however the second reason was for ventillation. Although it doesn't do much, it was design to be enough for air to circulate outwards and the visor to not fog up.
